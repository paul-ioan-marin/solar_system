# Simulare sistem solar

Computer graphics application that simulates the rotation of 2 planets, the Moon and the Sun. This application is purely demonstrative, the distances and dimensions aren't proportional. Moreover, for a better visibility, the simulation is made for Sun, Earth, Moon and another planet. The rest of them follow the same principles.

The repository doesn't include the patterns of the planets as they are protected by copyright.
